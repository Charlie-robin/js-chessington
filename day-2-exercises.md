# Day 2 Exercises

## Exercise 1: Static methods and properties

You may have seen or used the very useful `Math` utility class. This has lots of useful static methods and properties.

Read the docs about [static methods and properties]().

Let's make our own set of utility methods and properties, called `Maths`. A skeleton file and class is provided in `src/models/maths.js`

To run the tests for this exercise, run `npm run test:d2e1` in your terminal.

Let's implement the following:

1. The static property `Maths.PI`, which is equal to `3.14`
2. The static method `Maths.max(a, b)`, which returns the largest of `a` and `b`

## Inheritance

Speaking of maths and geometry, let's use shapes and polygons as a nice application of inheritance.

First, read the docs on [Inheritance]().



## Overriding
