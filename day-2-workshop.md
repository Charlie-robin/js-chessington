# Day 2 Workshop

## Task

You may have spotted that there is a class called `Piece` in `src/models/pieces/piece.js`.

The pieces in the folder should all _inherit_ from the `Piece` class.

Your task is to do the following:

1. Make all pieces inherit from the `Piece` class
1. Remove any _duplicated_ code from the child classes
1. Make sure the tests that _were_ passing before your refactor still pass

It's best to do refactors like this a small chunk at a time. It's hard to keep track of too many changes at once!

Once you have done that, you can continue with yesterday's task of implementing how each piece moves!
