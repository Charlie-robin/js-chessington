# Day 1 Exercises

You've been tasked with finishing off a chess timer, used to keep track of the time each player has left in a game.

## Exercise 1: Classes and Instances

First, have a read of [Classes and Instances]().

There's some existing code in: `src/models/chessTimer.js`, which needs some finishing off.


## Exercise 2: Instance methods

Now, have a look through [Instance methods]().

You will need to be able to start, toggle, and reset the timer.

We've already implemented the `start` and `stop` methods for you, but you'll need to implement the `toggle` and `reset` methods.

## Exercise 3: Private properties

Finally, read about [Private properties]().

We want to make sure that the `time` property is private, so that it can't be changed from outside the class.

## Extension: Timer increments

If you have time, add a feature to the timer so that it increments each time a player makes a move. This is a feature of many chess timers, and is used to make sure players still have time to make their moves, even if they're running low on time.
